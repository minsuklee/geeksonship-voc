# geeksonship-voc
This project is for Geeks On Ships Hackathon. 

It collects gas sensor data on ship under building and ship cruizing,
and visualizes in 3 dimension.

Functions:
  1. collect VOC sensor data
  2. visualize sensor value
  3. alarm dangerous area
  4. alarm when workers or crew entering dangerous spot
  5. guide points where fans should be installed
  6. guide workers for rest area (relatively low sensor zone),
  7. show visalized data on BIG display board.
  8. guide path way where sensor value is low
  9. using VR device see the gas flow.
  10. alaram when LNG, LPG is leaking
  11. 
  
In the first stage  <-- we are at this point (2015.10.22)
  no sensor network, no server, no web client
  simulated sensor data, Andriod client

In the second stage
  better visualization on Android client
  Change data protocol using json

In the third stage
  Alarm and safe spot guide

In the 4th stage
  do the sever
  web client
  EVERYTHING
